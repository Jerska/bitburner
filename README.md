# Jerska's bitburner space

[bitburner](https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/) is an online idle game where most aspects can be automated through JS code.

This repository is my personal collection of scripts & tools used in my bitburner game.

<em>Contract solver</em>

</a>

This page is an online tool to solve any contract of the game.
It is meant to be used before programmatic solving is doable (i.e. not enough RAM in home).

The page provides an input in which to copy the entire contract content.
Once pasted, the correct solver is taken and the solution displayed (and optionally copied to your clipboard).
